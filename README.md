# 🎬 **Movie Recommender System** 🎥

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System**! 🍿 This smart tool suggests movies to users based on content similarity and past viewing history. Whether you're looking for your next binge or a new favorite, this system will help you discover the perfect movie! 🎉

## 🚀 **Features**

* **Personalized Recommendations**: Get movie suggestions tailored to your preferences based on your viewing history and movie metadata. 🎥
* **Content-based Filtering**: Suggestions based on genres, keywords, cast, and crew to match your tastes. 📊
* **Real-Time Suggestions**: Recommendations are constantly updated to reflect new trends and movies. 🔄
* **Customizable Filters**: Filter suggestions based on genre, year, ratings, and more! 🔎
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive, and easy to use—no technical skills required! ✨

## 💻 **How It Works**

The **Movie Recommender System** uses a combination of **content-based filtering** and **semantic embeddings** to suggest movies. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection**: The system collects data from movie metadata, such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and descriptions.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Movie overviews are cleaned, and relevant features (genres, keywords, cast, crew) are transformed into a unified format.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Using **BERT embeddings** (via the `SentenceTransformer` model), the system generates vector representations of movie tags for semantic comparison.
4. **Cosine Similarity**: The system calculates cosine similarity between movies to find those that are most similar to each other.
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the similarity score, the system recommends movies that closely match your tastes. 📈

## ⚙️ **Installation Instructions**

To run the **Movie Recommender System** locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhasish20/Movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies:

```

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen prompts to get movie recommendations!

## 📊 **Technologies Used**

The **Movie Recommender System** is built with the following technologies:

* **Python** 🐍: The primary programming language used for data processing and model building.
* **Pandas** 📊: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-Learn** 🤖: For machine learning algorithms and text vectorization techniques.
* **Streamlit** 🌐: To build the web interface (optional, depending on how you'd like to interact with the system).
* **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: For using pre-trained language models like **BERT** for generating semantic embeddings.
* **MovieLens Dataset** 🎥: Used for example data (optional if you want a demo with real-world data).
